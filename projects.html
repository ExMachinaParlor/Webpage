                <h3>Tengu Marauder</h3>
                <p>
                    The Tengu Marauder is a mobile platform based on the ESP32 microcontroller, 
                    combining WiFi network security features with advanced robotic control and 
                    video streaming. It supports WiFi scanning, deauthentication attacks, and 
                    packet sniffing. The project integrates ROS2 for movement and uses the ESP32-CAM 
                    for live video streaming.

                <h3>Strix Interceptor</h3>
                <p>
                    The Strix Interceptor is an open-source UAV designed for drone interception 
                    and defense against RF systems. It features autonomous flight, stability control, 
                    and RF spoofing using components like the Pixhawk Flight Controller, 
                    Raspberry Pi, and HackRF One.
